# Observability Setup

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read NFR design (observability strategy) from `<record>/construction/nfr-design/`
- Read infrastructure design from `<record>/construction/infrastructure-design/`
- Read deployment execution log from `<record>/operation/deployment-execution/`

`express` skips NFR Design and Infrastructure Design by design. When those
artifacts are absent, derive the minimum observable surface from approved
requirements, the deployed application's workspace configuration, Build and
Test results, and the Deployment Execution evidence. Ask for any SLO, signal,
retention, or escalation decision that cannot be observed from those sources;
never invent a missing design artifact. If no deployed target exists, this
CONDITIONAL stage reports skipped.

### Step 2: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create questions file covering:
- What are the golden signals to track (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)?
- What SLOs/SLIs are defined?
- What dashboard layouts does the team need?
- What log retention and aggregation rules apply?
- What distributed tracing instrumentation is needed?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Generate Artifacts

Create CloudWatch dashboard configurations, alarm definitions (with severity, SNS routing, escalation), SLO/SLI tracking configuration, CloudWatch Logs Insights saved queries, X-Ray tracing configuration, and anomaly detection configuration.

### Step 4: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage observability-setup --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 5: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :eyes:
Review path: `<record>/operation/observability-setup/`
Standard 2-option approval (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/operation/observability-setup/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `performance-design`, `security-design`, `reliability-design`, `monitoring-design`, `infrastructure-specification`.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
