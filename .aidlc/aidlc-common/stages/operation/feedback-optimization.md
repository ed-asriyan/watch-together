# Continuous Feedback & Optimization

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read observability setup from `<record>/operation/observability-setup/`
- Read performance validation results from `<record>/operation/performance-validation/`
- Read SLO/SLI configuration
- Read infrastructure design for drift comparison

### Step 2: Generate Questions

Create questions file covering:
- Are SLOs being met? What is the error budget burn rate?
- Are there cost optimization opportunities?
- Is there configuration or infrastructure drift?
- What user behavior patterns suggest new features or issues?
- What operational toil can be automated?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Generate Artifacts

Create SLO compliance report, AWS Cost Explorer analysis & optimization recommendations, AWS Config drift detection report, Trusted Advisor recommendations review, operational insights & improvement proposals, and feedback loop document (inputs to next Ideation cycle).

### Step 4: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage feedback-optimization --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 5: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :recycle:
Review path: `<record>/operation/feedback-optimization/`
Approval gate: Approve (workflow complete) / Request Changes / Start New Ideation Cycle.

This is the final stage. Upon approval, the full AI-DLC workflow is complete. The feedback loop document feeds insights back into the next Ideation cycle if the user chooses to continue iterating.

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/operation/feedback-optimization/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `dashboards`, `alarms`, `slo-config`, `deployment-log`, `load-test-results`, `incident-plan`.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
