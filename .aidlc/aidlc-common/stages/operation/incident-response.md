# Incident Response & Runbook Generation

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read observability setup from `<record>/operation/observability-setup/`
- Read NFR design from `<record>/construction/nfr-design/`
- Read infrastructure design from `<record>/construction/infrastructure-design/`

### Step 2: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create questions file covering:
- What are the most likely failure modes?
- What are the escalation paths and on-call rotations?
- What automated remediation is possible?
- What are the communication procedures during incidents?
- What are the RTO/RPO targets?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Generate Artifacts

Create SSM Automation runbook library, incident response plan (integrated with AWS Incident Manager), escalation matrix, automated remediation documents, disaster recovery procedures, and AWS Backup configuration.

### Step 4: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage incident-response --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 5: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :fire_engine:
Review path: `<record>/operation/incident-response/`
Standard 2-option approval (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/operation/incident-response/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `dashboards`, `alarms`, `reliability-design`, `security-design`, `infrastructure-specification`.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
