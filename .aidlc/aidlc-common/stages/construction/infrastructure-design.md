# Infrastructure Design

## Constraints

This is a design stage — artifacts describe what infrastructure is needed and why, not implementation-ready code. Complete IaC (CDK constructs, Terraform modules, CloudFormation), full Lambda handlers, and IAM policy documents belong in code-generation. Limit code to short illustrative snippets (pseudocode or interface-level, ≤15 lines) that clarify a design decision.

## Steps

### Execution Modes

This stage supports two execution modes, controlled by the orchestrator:

**QUESTION-ONLY mode** (invoked by orchestrator during a Bolt's question phase):
Execute Steps 1–3 only (read artifacts, generate questions, collect answers).
Do NOT proceed to design or artifact generation. Return control to the orchestrator.

**ARTIFACT-ONLY mode** (invoked by orchestrator during a Bolt's design phase):
Skip Steps 1–3 (questions already collected and approved).
Read the answered questions file from the per-unit directory.
Execute Steps 4–7 only (design infrastructure, generate artifacts, update state, completion).

**Full mode** (default — single-unit projects or direct stage invocation):
Execute all steps sequentially as written.

### Step 1: Read Prior Artifacts

Read all prior design artifacts for context:
- NFR design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/` (if exists)
- Functional design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if exists)
- Domain design (component catalogue) from `<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md` (if exists)
- Inter-unit contracts from `<record>/inception/contract-design/contract-summary.md` (if produced) — boundary integration mechanisms (sync/async/shared store) inform networking, messaging, and shared-resource provisioning
- NFR requirements from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/` (if exists)

Incremental scopes (infra) skip the domain-design and functional-design chain by design. When those inputs are absent, derive the component topology from the NFR requirements and, on brownfield, the reverse-engineered code knowledge base at `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/` — never invent the content of a missing artifact.

### Step 2: Generate Infrastructure Questions

Create a questions file at `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/infrastructure-design-questions.md` with context-appropriate questions using [Answer]: tags.

Focus areas:
- Deployment strategy (containerized, serverless, hybrid, multi-region)
- Compute/storage/networking (sizing, topology, latency requirements)
- Monitoring approach (metrics, logging, tracing, alerting thresholds)
- CI/CD pipeline (build stages, deployment strategy, rollback procedures)
- Secrets management (vault, environment variables, rotation policy)
- Scaling policy (auto-scaling triggers, capacity limits, cost constraints)

### Step 3: Collect and Analyze Answers

Collect answers following stage-protocol.md §3 question flow (offer interaction mode choice, collect answers, write back to file). After collecting answers, perform MANDATORY ambiguity analysis:
- Identify vague answers ("cloud-based", "auto-scale", "standard monitoring")
- Check for contradictions between answers
- Flag missing details needed for artifact generation

If ANY ambiguity found: create follow-up questions and resolve before proceeding.

### Step 4: Design Infrastructure

Design infrastructure across four areas:

- **Deployment Architecture**: Compute model (containers, serverless, VMs), networking topology, storage strategy, environment layout (dev/staging/prod)
- **Infrastructure Services**: Databases (type, sizing, replication), caches (strategy, eviction), message queues, search services, CDN, DNS, load balancers
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics collection, log aggregation, distributed tracing, alerting rules, dashboards, SLI/SLO tracking
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build stages, test stages, deployment stages, environment promotion, rollback strategy, feature flags, artifact management

### Step 5: Generate Artifacts

Generate the following in `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/`. Keep the content **tabular** — the deployment, services, and shared sections are tables, and monitoring is tabular wherever it can be. Prose is for rationale only, not for data a table can hold.

**1. `infrastructure-specification.md`** — the core infrastructure design: deployment, infrastructure services, and any shared resources, folded into one document. Structure it as:

- **Deployment** — a table of deployment facets:
  `| Facet | Choice | Rationale |`
  with rows for compute model (containers/serverless/VMs/hybrid), networking topology (ingress/egress, VPC/subnet), storage strategy, environments (dev/staging/prod), IaC approach, and resource sizing.
- **Infrastructure Services** — a table keyed by service:
  `| Service | Role | Configuration | Notes |`
  (role = database / cache / queue / search / cdn / dns / load-balancer; configuration = sizing, replication, eviction, etc.).
- **Shared Infrastructure** (CONDITIONAL — only when multiple units share resources) — a table:
  `| Shared Resource | Owner Unit | Consumer Units | Access Boundary |`

**2. `monitoring-design.md`** — the platform-specific monitoring that implements the `observability-design` strategy from NFR Design, tabular wherever possible:

- **Metrics & KPIs** — `| Metric | Source | Threshold | Why it matters |`
- **Alerts** — `| Alert | Condition | Severity | Routes to |`
- **SLIs / SLOs** — `| SLI | SLO target | Measurement window |`
- **Logs & Tracing** — log aggregation strategy and tracing configuration (short prose or a small table); dashboard specifications.

**3. `cicd-pipeline.md`** — the delivery pipeline: build stages, test-automation integration, deployment strategy (blue-green / canary / rolling), rollback procedures, environment promotion, and secrets management in CI/CD. Steps are inherently sequential, so prose or an ordered list is fine here; use a table for the stage→gate mapping where it helps.

Create
`<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/traceability.json`.
Enumerate every `NFRx.y` design decision that requires infrastructure and map
it to the concrete resource or configuration:

```json
{
  "stage": "infrastructure-design",
  "unit": "u1-auth",
  "upstream_ids": ["NFR1.1", "NFR3.1"],
  "coverage": [
    { "id": "NFR1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "ElastiCache cluster" },
    { "id": "NFR3.1", "status": "GAP" }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage infrastructure-design --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 7: Completion

Present completion message and approval gate:

```
# :cloud: Infrastructure Design Complete — {unit-name}
```

Summary of infrastructure decisions and service selections, then:

```
**Review:** `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/`
```

Approval gate: strictly 2-option (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown design artefacts under `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/`. Some sections include code samples that the code-shape sensors can also flag.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`, `linter`, `type-check`, `traceability`.

Upstream targets: `performance-design`, `security-design`, `scalability-design`, `reliability-design`, `observability-design`, `logical-components`, `components`, `functional-spec`, `contract-summary`.

`linter` and `type-check` inspect matching TypeScript/JavaScript snippets.
`traceability` verifies that every infrastructure-relevant `NFRx.y` design
decision is declared and covered.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
