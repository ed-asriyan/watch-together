# CI Pipeline

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read build/test results from `<record>/construction/build-and-test/` (if exists)
- Read code summary from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/` (if exists)
- Read infrastructure design from `<record>/construction/infrastructure-design/` (if exists)
- Read workspace profile for existing CI configuration

Incremental scopes (infra) skip code-generation and build-and-test by design; when those inputs are absent, base the pipeline stages on the workspace's existing build/test setup (detected from the repo itself) instead — never invent the content of a missing artifact.

### Step 2: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create `<record>/construction/ci-pipeline/ci-pipeline-questions.md` with questions:
- What CI tool is in use (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)?
- What is the branch strategy?
- What quality gates are required before merge?
- What artifact repositories are used (ECR, CodeArtifact, S3)?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Collect and Analyze Answers

Validate CI choices against existing infrastructure and team capabilities.

### Step 4: Generate Artifacts

Create CI pipeline configuration (buildspec.yml, workflow YAML, or equivalent), quality gate definitions, and artifact repository configuration.

### Step 5: Phase Boundary Verification

Run Construction → Operation verification check:
- Read
  `<record>/construction/build-and-test/cross-unit-traceability.md`.
- Read every
  `<record>/construction/*/code-generation/traceability.json`.
- Confirm all Units built and tested, all code-generation tables have no
  unresolved findings, and the cross-Unit FR/NFR/AC gate passed.
- Confirm the CI quality gates enforce the build and test commands recorded by
  Build and Test.
- Write the boundary verdict to
  `<record>/verification/phase-check-construction.md`.

If any traceability file is missing or any unresolved finding remains, stop
the Construction → Operation transition and revisit the owning stage.

### Step 6: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage ci-pipeline --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 7: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :gear:
Review path: `<record>/construction/ci-pipeline/`
Standard 2-option approval (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown design artefacts under `<record>/construction/ci-pipeline/`. Some sections include code samples that the code-shape sensors can also flag.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`, `linter`, `type-check`.

Upstream targets: `code-summary`, `build-and-test-summary`, `build-test-results`.

`linter` and `type-check` inspect matching TypeScript/JavaScript snippets in
the design outputs.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
