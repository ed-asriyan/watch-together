# Feasibility & Constraint Analysis

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read intent statement from `<record>/ideation/intent-capture/`
- Read market research from `<record>/ideation/market-research/` (if exists)
- Load guardrails from
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/{org,team,project}.md`

### Step 2: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create `<record>/ideation/feasibility/feasibility-questions.md` with questions:
- What existing systems must this integrate with?
- Are there regulatory/compliance requirements (PCI, HIPAA, SOC2, data residency)?
- What is the team's current tech stack and skill profile?
- What are the budget and timeline constraints?
- Are there organizational blockers (change freeze, competing priorities)?
- What AWS services and accounts are currently in use?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Collect and Analyze Answers

Run ambiguity detection and contradiction analysis.

### Step 4: Generate Artifacts

Create feasibility assessment (technical viability, risk analysis), constraint register (technical, organizational, regulatory), and RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies).

The orchestrator will pass these artifacts to aidlc-aws-platform-agent for AWS landscape assessment and aidlc-compliance-agent for regulatory scanning, then synthesize all inputs.

### Step 5: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage feasibility --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 6: Present Completion & Request Approval

Review path: `<record>/ideation/feasibility/`
Standard approval gate (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/ideation/feasibility/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `intent-statement`, `competitive-analysis`, `market-trends`, `build-vs-buy`.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
