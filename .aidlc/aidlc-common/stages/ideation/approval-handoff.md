# Initiative Approval & Handoff

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

Read ALL Ideation phase artifacts:
- Intent statement and stakeholder map from `<record>/ideation/intent-capture/`
- Market research from `<record>/ideation/market-research/` (if exists)
- Feasibility assessment, constraint register, RAID log from `<record>/ideation/feasibility/` (if exists)
- Scope definition and intent backlog from `<record>/ideation/scope-definition/`
- Team formation artifacts from `<record>/ideation/team-formation/` (if exists)
- Mockups/wireframes from `<record>/ideation/rough-mockups/` (if exists)

### Step 2: Generate Approval Questions

Create `<record>/ideation/approval-handoff/approval-handoff-questions.md` with questions:
- Do all stakeholders agree on the intent and scope?
- Have all critical risks been acknowledged with mitigations?
- Is there budget/resource commitment?
- Do the rough mockups reflect the shared vision?
- Does the market research support the investment?
- Are mobs staffed and scheduled?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Compile Initiative Brief

Create `<record>/ideation/approval-handoff/initiative-brief.md` — a one-pager combining:
- Intent and problem statement
- Market validation summary
- Feasibility and risk highlights
- Scope boundary
- Concept visuals
- Team plan
- Go/no-go recommendation

Create `<record>/ideation/approval-handoff/decision-log.md` — record of all decisions made during Ideation.

### Step 4: Phase Boundary Verification

Run Ideation → Inception verification check:
- Intent → Scope → Intent Backlog consistency
- All scope items have feasibility backing
- Write results to `<record>/verification/phase-check-ideation.md`

### Step 5: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .aidlc/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage approval-handoff --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 6: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :white_check_mark:
Review path: `<record>/ideation/approval-handoff/`
Approval gate: Approve (proceed to Inception) / Request Changes / Reject Initiative (end workflow).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/ideation/approval-handoff/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `intent-statement`, `stakeholder-map`, `scope-document`, `intent-backlog`, `competitive-analysis`, `feasibility-assessment`, `constraint-register`, `team-assessment`, `wireframes`.

## Learn

Follow stage-protocol.md §13: maintain `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`
under the four standard headings while working; before the approval gate,
surface candidates with `aidlc-learnings.ts`;
still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question, and persist confirmed selections
with the tool. The memory file stays in the artefact directory, and the stage
file remains immutable.
